# AWDCS

A scope-based keymap system that brings simplicity and clarity to modal editor configurations through mindful organization and purposeful design.

## Philosophy

Traditional modal editor keymaps typically organize bindings by tool or function.

But I noticed a pattern in my thinking: I always consider the scope first.

- I want to toggle the **App** keymaps.
- I want to search the entire **Workspace** for...
- I want to look in this **Document** for...
- I want to do something with this **Change**...
- I want to rename that **Symbol**...

**That's when I decided to adapt my modal editor to this mental model.**

This system takes a different approach by organizing mappings based on their scope of operation:

```
<Scope><?Group?><Operation>
```

- **[A]pp** (`<leader>a`) - Application-level operations
- **[W]orkspace** (`<leader>w`) - Operations affecting the entire workspace
- **[D]ocument** (`<leader>d`) - Operations on the current document
- **[C]hange** (`<leader>c`) - Operations on a change (Hunk)
- **[S]ymbol** (`s`) - Operations on code symbols

## Design Principles

- **Scope First**
  - Every operation must clearly belong to a specific scope (workspace, document, symbol)
  - The scope should be immediately obvious from the operation's nature
- **Semantic Operations**
  - Mappings should represent clear, meaningful operations
  - Focus on frequently used operations that benefit from quick access
  - Focus on what the operation means, not how it's implemented
- **Tool & Editor Agnostic**:
  - Mappings should be independent of specific tools or editors
  - Use semantic terms (e.g., 'History' instead of 'Git')
  - Implementation details are left to the user's configuration
- **Preserve Editor Defaults**:
  - Don't replace basic editor operations with custom mappings
  - Focus on operations that enhance rather than replace core functionality
  - Leave common editor commands in their traditional form
- **Consistent Patterns**:
  - Second key should relate to the action within the scope
  - Related operations should share the same scope
  - Maintain predictable patterns across all mappings
- **Single Source**:
  - Each operation should have exactly one mapping
  - Avoid duplicate mappings across different key combinations
  - Choose the most appropriate and efficient mapping location

## Leader Key

I personally use (and recommend) `,` as my leader key, but you can use any key you like.
This way we use both hands in combination when typing the keymaps, which reduces strain by balancing the workload on the fingers.
Also I find that the the middle finger is faster than the thumb, which is generally a good thing, but also very nice to quickly double tap the leader key, to reach the command mode.

## Keymap

### `<leader><leader>` - Global

This is a little bit of a special case, as it's not really a keymap, but a global command.
This is an alternative way to quickly enter the command mode (same as `:`), which lends to increased direct usage of the builtin commands without mapping them.

Since I am using home row mods (really bottom row mods.. See my layout [here](https://github.com/nikbrunner/koyo>), I sometimes get missfires for quickly typing `:`.
When quickly dobule tapping the leader key, I quickly and safely reach the command mode, without worrying about typos.

This is of course just personal preference.

For example in Neovim you can create a mapping like so:

```lua
vim.keymap.set({ "n", "x" }, "<leader><leader>", function()
    vim.api.nvim_feedkeys(":", "n", true)
end, { desc = "Command Mode" })
```

### Alphabetical Order

All keybindings in each scope are listed alphabetically for easier reference and maintenance, not by frequency of use or importance.

### Ergonomic Design

When using `,` as the leader key, the system naturally creates efficient left-hand finger patterns. The scope key (first key after leader) and the operation key (second key) are often adjacent or nearby on the keyboard (e.g., `sa`, `we`, `wd`), minimizing finger travel and creating comfortable rolling motions for the left hand. This ergonomic benefit is a fortunate consequence of the alphabetical organization combined with the QWERTY layout's letter placement.

### `s` - [S]ymbol

> [!NOTE]
> Unlike other scopes, symbol operations do not use the leader key due to their high frequency of use.
> This intentional exception optimizes for efficiency while maintaining the semantic meaning of the scope.
> **But of course it is possible to just also use the leader prefix before that!**

> [!CAUTION]
> If you plan to use it without a leader prefix, and use Neovim, I would recommend to disable the default `s` Binding.
> Yes- this goes against the principle not to overwrite editor defaults, but it is (at least for me), not a used keymapping, and is also often overridden by other plugins and systems.

You can disable the default mapping in Neovim like so:

```lua
vim.keymap.set("n", "s", "<Nop>")
```
